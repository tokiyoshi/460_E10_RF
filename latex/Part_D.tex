This part is originally for the measurement of the linear thermal expansion coefficients of copper and aluminum. To measure thermal expansion coefficient, the temperature of copper cavity or aluminum rod should be varied, and corresponding resonance frequency need to be measured. Therefore, $V_{tune}$ and corresponding VCO frequency must be locked to the resonance frequency of copper cavity or aluminum rod, so the frequency can be measured with only varying the temperature of the cavity or rod. To lock the $V_{tune}$, integrator feedback control is inserted between the mixer and $V_{tune}$ port of the VCO. By turning off the lock, modifying gain with the cream coloured small driver, and turning on the lock again, the immediate jump to the resonant frequency from the modified frequency has observed. Since the temperature of the cavity could not be modified because of the equipment problem, the only frequency lock observed is lock to the resonance frequency used in previous sections, with the same room temperature.\\

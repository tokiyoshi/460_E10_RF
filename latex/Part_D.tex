This part is originally for the measurement of the linear thermal expansion coefficients of copper and aluminum. To measure thermal expansion coefficient, the temperature of copper cavity or aluminum rod should be varied, and corresponding resonance frequency need to be measured. Therefore, $V_{tune}$ and corresponding VCO frequency must be locked to the resonance frequency of copper cavity or aluminum rod, so the frequency can be measured with only varying the temperature of the cavity or rod. To lock the &V_{tune}&, integrator feedback control is inserted between the mixer and &V_{tune}& port of the VCO.\\
The cavity temperature could not be modified due to the equipment problem. Therefore, we only stabilized the VCO to the cavity.
